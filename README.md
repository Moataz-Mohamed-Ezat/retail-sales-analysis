# Retail Sales Analysis Project

#Note!!!!!

This project utilizes synthetic data generated specifically for academic analysis.  
The dataset was designed to resemble real retail transaction patterns while maintaining data privacy and avoiding the use of real customer information.


## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to analyze retail store data to support business decision-making after the store resumed operations following a closure period. The primary goal is to maximize sales, evaluate promotion effectiveness, optimize inventory management, and identify high-performing products and categories.

The store management seeks to:
- Identify top-performing products and categories.
- Evaluate the impact of promotions and discounts on sales.
- Analyze customer distribution across regions.
- Improve inventory planning during high-demand periods.
- Increase overall profitability through data-driven strategies.

## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset represents a retail transactional system and includes:
- Customers and demographic information.
- Products and categories.
- Orders and order details.
- Promotions and discounts.
- Inventory transactions.
- Price history for products.

The data was generated and managed using SQL Server and enriched using Python for data simulation.
